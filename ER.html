        <h2>Assignment Name: Pharmacy Database ER Model</h2>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> This assignment involves designing an ER model for a pharmacy database, addressing the relationships and structural constraints among entities like Pharmaceutical Companies, Drugs, Pharmacies, Doctors, and Patients.</p>
        <h3>Features:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Defined entities such as Pharmaceutical Companies, Drugs, Pharmacies, Doctors, and Patients.</li>
            <li>Established relationships with attributes like contracts, prescriptions, and sales.</li>
            <li>Specified primary and foreign keys for all entity and relationship sets.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Challenges and Solutions:</h3>
        <p>One of the key challenges was mapping the many-to-many relationships between Pharmacies and Pharmaceutical Companies. This was resolved by introducing a Contract entity with attributes for terms, start date, and end date.</p>
        <h3>Reflection:</h3>
        <p>Designing this model helped solidify concepts of entity-relationship modeling, relational schema mapping, and understanding of structural constraints and primary key selection.</p>
