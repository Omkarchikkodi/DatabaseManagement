        <h2>Assignment Name: Normalization and Transaction Processing</h2>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> This assignment focused on designing and optimizing the Pharmacy database through normalization and implementing transaction processing to ensure reliable and consistent multi-user operations.</p>
        <h3>Features:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Normalized the database to the Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity.</li>
            <li>Implemented a transaction management system ensuring ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).</li>
            <li>Ensured proper concurrency control using Two-Phase Locking (2PL) mechanism.</li>
            <li>Optimized query performance with appropriate indexing on foreign keys and frequently queried attributes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Challenges and Solutions:</h3>
        <p>
            A key challenge was managing many-to-many relationships between Pharmaceutical Companies and Pharmacies. This was resolved by introducing a `Contracts` table with attributes such as `StartDate`, `EndDate`, and `Terms`. For transaction processing, handling deadlocks was addressed by implementing a timeout mechanism in the locking process.
        </p>
        <h3>Reflection:</h3>
        <p>
            This assignment significantly enhanced my understanding of database normalization principles and their practical application in real-world systems. Implementing transaction management systems helped me learn techniques to ensure data consistency and reliability, even in multi-user environments.
