        <h2>Assignment Name: Normalization and Transaction Processing</h2>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> This assignment focused on designing and optimizing the Pharmacy database through normalization and implementing transaction processing to ensure reliable and consistent multi-user operations.</p>
        <h3>Features:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Normalized the database to the Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity.</li>
            <li>Implemented a transaction management system ensuring ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).</li>
            <li>Ensured proper concurrency control using Two-Phase Locking (2PL) mechanism.</li>
            <li>Optimized query performance with appropriate indexing on foreign keys and frequently queried attributes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Challenges and Solutions:</h3>
        <p>
            A key challenge was managing many-to-many relationships between Pharmaceutical Companies and Pharmacies. This was resolved by introducing a `Contracts` table with attributes such as `StartDate`, `EndDate`, and `Terms`. For transaction processing, handling deadlocks was addressed by implementing a timeout mechanism in the locking process.
        </p>
        <h3>Reflection:</h3>
        <p>
            This assignment significantly enhanced my understanding of database normalization principles and their practical application in real-world systems. Implementing transaction management systems helped me learn techniques to ensure data consistency and reliability, even in multi-user environments.

            <h2>First Normal Form (1NF)</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A database table is in the First Normal Form (1NF) if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each column contains atomic (indivisible) values.</li>
                <li>There are no repeating groups or arrays in any column.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In 1NF, the focus is on ensuring that data is stored in a structured and consistent manner. All values in a column must be of the same type, and no single field should contain multiple values.</p>
            <p><strong>Significance:</strong> 1NF eliminates redundancy by ensuring the database contains a flat structure.</p>

        <article id="2nf">
            <h2>Second Normal Form (2NF)</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A table is in the Second Normal Form (2NF) if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is already in 1NF.</li>
                <li>All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> 2NF addresses the issue of partial dependency, which occurs when a non-key attribute depends on only part of a composite primary key. By removing these partial dependencies, the table is split into smaller tables, ensuring that every non-key attribute relates directly to the full primary key.</p>
            <p><strong>Significance:</strong> 2NF ensures that each piece of data is stored in the correct table and reduces data redundancy further.</p>
        </article>

        <article id="3nf">
            <h2>Third Normal Form (3NF)</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A table is in the Third Normal Form (3NF) if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is already in 2NF.</li>
                <li>No non-prime attribute is transitively dependent on the primary key.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> 3NF focuses on eliminating transitive dependencies, where a non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute. This is achieved by creating separate tables to ensure that each attribute directly relates to the primary key.</p>
            <p><strong>Significance:</strong> 3NF improves data integrity and reduces anomalies by ensuring that every attribute provides a fact about the primary key.</p>

        <article id="bcnf">
            <h2>Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A table is in the Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is already in 3NF.</li>
                <li>Every determinant is a candidate key.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> BCNF is a stricter version of 3NF. It ensures that all functional dependencies are on a superkey (a key that uniquely identifies rows). BCNF resolves cases where a non-prime attribute determines a candidate key.</p>
            <p><strong>Significance:</strong> BCNF eliminates all redundancy caused by functional dependencies, making the database design more robust and efficient.</p>
